archup (https://code.launchpad.net/~r0rschach/+junk/archup) is a small C application which informs the user when system-updates for Archlinux are available.

archup uses GTk+ and libnotify to show a desktop notification if updates are available. It uses "pacman -Qu"
to get the list of the pending updates. You have to update the database yourself with "pacman -Sy". You can setup
a cronjob, executing "pacman -Sy" hourly and executing archup afterwards.
